# Open Data Structures – C++ Exercise Templates

This repository contains C++ templates and solutions for exercises from [Open Data Structures](http://opendatastructures.org/), a free and open-source textbook on data structures.

## 📂 Structure

### `arrayExTem/`
This folder includes template files for exercises from the **Arrays** chapter. These templates are minimal C++ setups that define the problem structure without full implementations, meant for practicing and solving the problems yourself.

### `arrayExTem/arryExtemAll.cpp`
An example file with multiple array-related implementations combined together. This may serve as a scratchpad or bulk practice file.
