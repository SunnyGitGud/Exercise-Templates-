# Array-Based Data Structure Exercises

This directory contains individual template files for each exercise from Chapter 2.7.

## Exercises Generated:

- **Exercise 2.1**: ArrayStack wastes memory after remove() operations
  File: `exercise_2_1.cpp`

- **Exercise 2.3**: Implement RootishArrayStack space analysis
  File: `exercise_2_3.cpp`

- **Exercise 2.4**: Implement robust error handling
  File: `exercise_2_4.cpp`

- **Exercise 2.5**: Compare various array resizing policies
  File: `exercise_2_5.cpp`


## How to Build and Run:

```bash
# Compile an exercise (example for Exercise 2.1)
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 exercise_2_1.cpp -o exercise_2_1

# Run the exercise
./exercise_2_1
```

## Implementation Notes:

- Each file contains the class definition with TODO comments
- Complete test suite is included
- Implementation hints are provided at the top of each file
- Focus on one exercise at a time for better learning

## Common Compilation Flags:

- `-std=c++11` or higher for modern C++ features
- `-O2` for optimized performance testing
- `-Wall -Wextra` for additional warnings
- `-g` for debugging information
